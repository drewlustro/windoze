A bunch of AutoHotkey scripts that emulate common keystrokes for OS X users.
Mostly because CTRL hurts the hand and I am sad when I'm deving on Windows for the first time
in nearly 10 years.

**NOTE:** This assumes your `LWIN` key is luxuriously remapped to `LCTRL` using the an old school Windows Resource Kit admin tool `remapkey`.
This will give you the "Oh I have the OS X command key back!" sort of joy... almost.
Take a look at how to [remap the windows key to "COMMAND"](http://superuser.com/questions/514903/remapping-keys-without-external-software).


### Commands Offered (New -> Effect)

* `CTRL`+`Q` = `ALT`+`F4` (Quit Active App)
* `CTRL`+`M` = Minimize Active Window
* `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`D` = Toggle Desktop
* `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`Left Arrow` = Resize Window to Left Half
* `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`Right Arrow` = Resize Window to Right Half

### Requires

* [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/) (free as in beer, OSS)
